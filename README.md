# Alpha-Beta
For those who, after finishing 6.034 lab 3, realized they wanted so badly to play against their beautiful new creation: a wrapping of the alpha-beta search bot.



There are two ways you can use this repo:
- Clone it directly and just use my alpha-beta implementation (it should be mostly bug-freeâ€”message me if you find anything catastrophic), or
- Move the file `play_4.py` into your `lab3/` directory, then run `python play_4.py` from inside `lab3/`


Authorship credits:
- `play_4`: me
- `lab3`: 6.034 course staff (scaffolding), me (implementation of search algs)
- `game_api`, `boards`: 6.034 course staff
